# Crimes-and-Street-Lighting

This repository contains the project "Crimes-and-Street-Lighting," a group project for the course CS418 Introduction to Data Science. The aim of this project is to investigate the correlation between enhanced street lighting and its potential impact on crime rates, particularly in high-crime areas.

### Objectives
Analyze the correlation between street lighting and crime rates in Chicago neighborhoods.
Use machine learning models to predict the impact of enhanced street lighting on crime reduction.
Provide insights for law enforcement and urban planners to improve safety in high-crime areas.

### Models and Methods
  **Random Forest**: Used to analyze the importance of various features and predict outcomes. <br />
  **Logistic Regression**: Applied to model the relationship between street lighting and crime rates. <br />
  **Visualizations**: Created to illustrate the data and model results effectively.
